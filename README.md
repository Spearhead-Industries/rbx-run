# rbx-run

Running Roblox games in the terminal.
</div>

-----

## About

This tool provides a partial implementation of the Roblox API using [Lune](https://github.com/lune-org/lune) to aid in executing Roblox games in the terminal.

-----

## Usage

To run an rbxl file, simply use the following command;

```bash
rbx-run run [PATH]
```

This will implement the Roblox API and execute the scripts as the server.

-----

## Limitations

At the moment, the following limitations apply;

- rbx-run will only execute as if it were the server.
- Most of the Roblox API is unimplemeneted.

These limitations will reduce as time goes on. This tool was adapted from the Terahertz Game Framework CLI, as such it only implements methods the base THz framework uses.
